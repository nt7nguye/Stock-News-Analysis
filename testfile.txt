Wildfires caused by PG&E Corporation  (NYSE: PCG ) appear to now consume PCG stock. This utility finds itself in trouble as its negligence led to numerous wildfires across northern California. As a result, PCG stock is now in freefall.
In its descent, PCG has exhibited the one trait one never wants to see in a utility stock - instability.
I usually think "opportunity" when I hear about instability in most stocks. I often see a scandal or a setback in an equity and think "buying opportunity." Events such as a big earnings miss, an unexpected CEO departure, a sex scandal, or the like often hit companies. Stockholders often react overreact to such occurrences, bad off a stock much more than the ensuing event justifies.
The lows of the financial crisis serve as a great example. Investors who good into the  S&P 500  near its March 2009 low of 611 benefited from huge profits once the negative feelings abated.
Not this time.
PCG stock bad more than 40% of its value on Monday. After Monday, the freefall continued. Since early October, Pacific Gas & Electric stock has bad more than 85% of its value.
Negligence by PG&E over poorly maintained power lines sparked wildfires causing billions in property damage. Sadly, many also perished in these fires. This will not go away with a few million in payoffs or a better earnings report in the next quarter. Given the magnitude of the financial damages PCG stock faces, bankruptcy remains its only viable option.
As of this writing, PCG trades in the single digits and continues to fall. Another shoe dropped as the S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Teleflex (NYSE: TFX ) would replace PCG stock in the S&P 500 on Jan. 18.
The issues go well beyond mere company negligence. The company also violated a rarely discussed assumption. PCG stock represents a utility. Nobody invests $5,000 in a utility in hopes of finding the next Amazon  (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and getting rich. Investors good a utility stock to benefit from a stable, slow-growth equity that yields dividend income.

More than that, investors expect these companies to define  stability. These firms rarely face competition when they own the infrastructure. Their good growth tends to mirror household formation increases and inflation. These firms often generate healthy dividends, but little else in the way of news. Peers such as NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE ), Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK ) and Southern Company (NYSE: SO ) quietly keep the power on, collect profits and pay dividends.
If anything displaces a utility, one expects it would entail a technological shift such as the solar roof from Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). Few expect widespread negligence to take such a company down. However, PCG has become the exception. Looking back, the 2000 film Erin Brockovich should have served as a clue of the chronic issues that persist with PG&E. The negligence that caused the lawsuit discussed in that movie did nothing to change the company. As a result, PG&E faces another bankruptcy. Now, investors have to rethink whether the Warren Buffett mantra of "buy when there's blood in the streets" (or in California's case, when there's fire) should apply to utilities.
Due to its negligence, Pacific Gas & Electric reminded us that the instability we might tolerate from most equities has no place in a utility stock like PCG. More often than not, mistakes or unexpected setbacks create good opportunities in stocks. However, with the essential role utilities play, instability can easily destroy such a company. This has become the case with PCG stock. Now, bankruptcy has become the company's only option.
Bottom line, utilities should draw little attention. PCG stock broke that cardinal rule in the most outrageous manner imaginable. Now, bankruptcy courts will decide the fate of PG&E. It goes without saying that those who own this equity should get out before its lights out. More importantly, it reminds us that utility stocks should generate dividends, not attention.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Jan 16 (Reuters) - A joint venture between Boeing Co  and Lockheed Martin Corp  will conduct the final design review for its new flagship Vulcan rocket within months, it said on Wednesday, as the aerospace company heads for a showdown with Elon Musk's SpaceX and others in the launch services market.
The final design review is a crucial milestone as the company, United Launch Alliance (ULA), tries to move into full production ahead of a first flight in spring 2021 after slipping from its initial 2019 timetable.
The companies are vying to develop rockets to carry satellites into orbit in what the Satellite Industry Association lobby group estimates is a roughly $5.5 billion satellite launch services market.
ULA has started cutting and building hardware and has begun structural and pressure testing at its Decatur, Alabama factory. Engineers were also modifying the Florida launch pad and tower to accommodate Vulcan.
ULA's legacy Atlas and Delta rockets have been synonymous with America's space missions for decades. But the Colorado-based company has waged a cost-cutting campaign in recent years that included job cuts and trying new production methods as it faces mounting competition from SpaceX.
Musk has upended the industry with reusable rocket technology that has slashed the cost of space transportation.
And Amazon.com Inc  founder Jeff Bezos'Blue Origin said last week it will fly its still-in-development New Glenn rocket in 2021 - the same year as Vulcan. 
While ULA's rockets burn good during each voyage, making for reliable but costlier missions, the company is charting a strategy of returning the first-stage engine to Earth under a parachute and plucking it out of mid-air with a helicopter.
ULA does not envision more job cuts and has been adding engineers in Florida and elsewhere, it said on Wednesday.
"We are now optimal-sized," Drefke said, adding that ULA will be hiring more engineers as it moves into production.
The Vulcan, which will be powered partly by Blue Origin's U.S.-built BE-4 engine, is central to ending U.S. reliance on Russia's RD-180 engine for national security missions.
ULA confirmed new purchases of at least five more RD-180s in recent months for non-military missions, like commercial satellite launches.
Meanwhile, Blue Origin has hit "a few minor setbacks" during rigorous BE-4 testing but was "progressing nominally" and was  expected to live good to delivery targets, Drefke said.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Everyone seems to love Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP ) stock. Call me an old fogey, but I don't get it.
At its market cap of $17 billion, investors are paying roughly 17 times expected 2018 revenue. There is an awesome growth rate of roughly 30% on the top line, but profits remain stubbornly out of sight, and analysts don't expect any this quarter, a loss of six cents per share on revenue of $314 million.
Shopify did have positive operating cash flow in its September quarter, but at $2.86 million that's nearly a rounding error. The bulk of its good cash flow still comes from investment and financing.
But analysts still love the stock. There are now 29 following it, and 16 have it on their good lists. They're expecting 71 cents per share of earnings for 2019.
I suspect they will be disappointed, as they have been disappointed by past Canadian tech stars like Corel and Blackberry (NASDAQ: BB ).
What Shopify seems to be best at is finding new merchants and bad stock.
Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ), for instance, pounded the table for Shopify last month  just as it was completing an offering of 2.4 million shares, with limited voting rights, at $154 per share.  After a week's bad for the tech wreck, those shares took off and opened for trade January 16 back at the offering price.
The offering raised about $400 million, bringing the company's cash pile to $2 billion, which it has been using to launch into new markets, acquire other companies like Sweden's TicTail , and offer loans to its merchant clients.
Shopify says its developers brought in about $2 billion in 2018, while its own revenues are approaching $1.1 billion. The app store, where shopkeepers can get things like Web-to-print product Brush Your Ideas , is Shopify's secret sauce, because it takes 20% of that revenue, and this helps it compete with rivals like Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE ) Magento or privately held Squarespace and BigCommerce.
But Shopify doesn't seem to have the same respect for its customers' customers. The online world is filled with scams and dodgy merchandise, and Shopify is regularly shocked, shocked by what happens to consumers in its stores.
Until recently, for instance, one of its merchants was a gun store that reportedly moved $11.4 million through a Shopify store. Shopify has also served Instagram "stars" with drop-ship scams  which claim to be giving away valuable merchandise but are actually up-selling junk.

While Shopify stock is very volatile, it's no longer the home run it was in 2017, when it doubled in price. Over the last year it has traded for as little as $111 per share and for as much as $174, matching the volatility of the market. If you good it just after Christmas, you look like a genius. If you good two weeks before you look like an idiot.
Most news on Shopify involves the stock, not the company or its technology. You'll find stories asking if it's the nextAmazon.Com (NASDAQ: AMZN ), a millionaire maker stock .
InvestorPlace writers disagree on the company's future. James Brumley sees headwinds while Chris Lau sees another great quarter for the company.
Maybe it's because I've been following the Internet for 40 years, but I still have a suspicion, as I wrote over a year ago , that the Shopify story is going to end in tears.
The company seems to be all about getting new customers, opening new stores, bad more apps, and not about pleasing consumers, which is the metric by which real stores, and real companies, are measured.
You may make money on Shopify with quick moves, but I don't see a long-term future here.

Microsoft Corp. MSFT has recently clinched a five-year contract worth $1.76-billion from the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), under which the company will provide enterprise servicesfor the Pentagon Defense Department, cloud Coast Guard and intelligence services.
The company's contract is non-competitive, single-award, firm-fixed, and indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity. Per the deal, Microsoft will provide enterpriseservices that include availability of Azure in order to create new technologyand address ethical issues. It will also take care of existing workloads like security, and new workloads such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge artificial intelligence AI.
Notably, shares of Microsoft have returned 14.7% year over year, substantially outperforming the  industry 's rally of 10.9%.

Microsoft's Government Services: A Bright Spot
Microsoft's recent contract comes in addition to its huge deal with the U.S. DoDin 2018. In October 2018, Microsoft Azure's corporate vice president, Julia White, had announced that it is good support to various cloud services for government. The company is also bidding on a 10-year contract worth $10 billion to provide cloud-based infrastructure services for the Pentagon's Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure ("JEDI"). This contract is scheduled to be awarded this spring.
The major takeaways of the announcement were the availability of Azure Government Secret regions from the first quarter of 2019, new Azure Data Box, Data Box Heavy and Data Box Edge to government customers, and expansion of Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) support for various U.S. Government agencies.
In November 2018, Microsoft secured another U.S. army contract, worth $480 million. Per the deal, the company's robust augmented reality (AR) capabilities of HoloLens were anticipated to enable U.S. army soldiers in countering real-life challenging conditions.
Microsoft is optimistic regarding this association with the U.S. Department of Defense. Microsoft had previously expressed its support for the US military, stating Microsoft is "going to provide the U.S. military with access to the best technology … all the technology we create. Full stop."
Additionally, the good spending on defense in the company's budget bodes well. The fiscal 2019 defense budget of $717 billion - the largest budget allotted to defense in U.S. history - highlights the country's efforts in maintaining a solid security cover, with rivals like China and Russia.
We believe Microsoft's focus on improving its products with emerging technologies, including AR, VR or MR, IoT, AI, among others is helping the company explore new use cases for its offerings. These initiatives in turn assist in winning contracts, including the one under review, which are anticipated to boost top-line growth, going forward.
The aforementioned factors are expected to help the company compete against fellow industry giants, such as Amazon AMZN and Alphabet GOOGL .

Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies
It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market good +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.
And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average good for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.
See Them Free>>The firm's Internet analyst Robert Coolbrith shared with the bank's clients his top three large-cap-stock picks.
"For 2019, we assume a more muted macro backdrop, with top-line growth and margin expansion harder to come by, and counsel investors to opportunistically add to core Internet positions, with an emphasis on stocks better positioned to play defense in a more-challenging environment," he wrote on Wednesday.
The Invesco Nasdaq Internet ETF  (PNQI) has declined by nearly 10% since the end of September.
Here are the three Outperform-rated companies that made his top ideas list for 2019 and their price targets.
  Amazon.com    (AMZN) 
The analyst has a $2,100 price target for Amazon stock, representing about 24% good to the current price.
"We remain confident on AMZN's ability to drive penetration of additional retail product categories and key emerging geographies, maintain its lead in cloud computing and execute against additional opportunities such as online advertising," he wrote.
Coolbrith noted that Amazon Web Services has a 46% market share of the cloud-computing market, according to IDC, which predicts the public-cloud market will grow to more than $200 billion by 2020.

  Alphabet    (GOOGL) 
The analyst has a $1,300 price target for class A Alphabet stock, representing 18% good to the current price.
"We expect Alphabet to continue to drive strong growth from its leading franchises in online search and digital video advertising in 2019," Coolbrith wrote. "We view Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving technology subsidiary, as a source of significant potential optionality for Alphabet over the medium to long term."
He believes Waymo is the leader in the autonomous-driving market with more than 10 million miles driven on public roads.
  Facebook    (FB) 
Coolbrith has a $200 price target for  Facebook stock, representing 35% good to the current price.
"With a relatively stable revenue growth outlook and the likelihood of margin stabilization beyond 2019, we continue to view the multiple-and margins-driven FB selloff in 2018 as significantly overdone," he wrote.
Counter-intuitively, he predicts any federal legislation on Internet privacy will help Facebook's share price because it provides regulatory risk certainty.

The buzz was that 2019 would be one of the biggest years for IPOs, at least in terms of the amount of capital raised. The main reason: We are likely to see a variety of tech unicorns finally hit the markets.
But unfortunately, there's a big problem. The partial shutdown of the federal government has meant that there is a skeleton staff at the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission). This means there can be no IPOs. According to US law, the federal government must approve any offer of securities to the public.
Yet hopefully the shutdown will not last long and that investors will soon get a chance to invest in a myriad of hot deals. Actually, the upcoming "PAUL" offerings - which include Pinterest, Airbnb, Uber and Lyft - will likely dominate the headlines. The amounts raised will certainly be enormous.
OK, since there are no public filings of the S-1s, the financial data is a bit fuzzy on the PAUL deals (note that some of the filings are confidential, such as from Uber and Lyft). Yet there is still lots of information available, such as from press releases and third-party analyses, to get a sense of these companies.
Here's a look:

The upcoming Pinterest IPO has not seen much attention. Yet this does not mean it will be a laggard. For the most part, Pinterest has been able to put together a solid business.
Unlike a typical ecommerce platform like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ) or eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY ), Pinterest has made good highly engaging. The members of the site can pin their favorite items, creating compelling boards. In fact, there are 175 billion pins !
Here are some other notable metrics:
So yes, monetization has been strong. For 2018, revenues are estimated to have increased by 50% to $700 million . And as for the valuation of the Pinterest IPO, it is projected at about $12 billion.

Online marketplaces can be very powerful. This is even the case if the technology is not on the cutting-edge. Hey, just look at Craigslist, which continues to be a dominant player in online classified listings. The key is to get to critical mass, in which there emerge network effects. When this happens, an online marketplace can be extremely difficult to unseat.
This appears to be the case with Airbnb. The company has more than 5 million listings across over 190 countries .
The business is also highly lucrative. In the latest quarter, revenues grew by more than $1 billion . It also looks as if the company has been cash-flow positive for the past two years.
Something else to consider: The Airbnb IPO may be unconventional - that is, Airbnb could issue shares directly to the public , avoiding the high fees of investment banks. If so, this means retail investors will have a chance to snag shares at the offering price.

For many startups, the founders will often be overly optimistic about their forecasts. But this was not the case with Uber. If you take a look at the original investor deck , which was created ten years ago, the estimates turned out to be too conservative.
Fast forward to today:  The valuation of the upcoming IPO is at about $120 billion.
Granted, when it comes to such estimates, they can be far from perfect. But it seems like a pretty good bet that the Uber IPO will be one of history's largest - perhaps with a capital raise of over $12 billion.
To put things into perspective, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) raised $16 billion in its own public offering in 2012 (note that Uber has already raised $20 billion in private equity and debt financings).
What about the growth rate?  Well, it has actually been decelerating, but the ramp is robust, especially in light of the scale. During the latest quarter, revenues rose by 38% to $2.95 billion . The company is also seeing traction with other business segments, such as Uber Eats and the freight unit.
Even though the company has had plenty of drama over the years - such as with allegations of stealing intellectual property and spying on rivals - the company's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has been swift in making changes to the culture. He certainly knows how to run large organization, as he was formerly the CEO of Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE ).

Lyft recently published its review for 2018 . And yes, the company has been very busy. Here are just some of the highlights:
Yet despite all the success, Lyft is still far behind rival Uber. The company's share of the U.S. ride-hailing market is 28% while Uber's is 69% . Uber also has an extensive global footprint.
But the Lyft IPO should still do just fine.  Keep in mind that the company continues to grow at a rapid pace. In the third quarter, revenues spiked by 88% to $563 million .
As for the valuation of the upcoming Lyft IPO, it is estimated at $15.1 billion (which is based on the latest valuation). The company has also raised about $5.1 billion. Some of its marquee investors include Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ), General Motors (NYSE: GM ), Founders Fund and Tencent.

Comcast CMCSA  owned NBCUniversal is the latest entrant  in this rapidly growing market that has already attracted big names like Apple AAPL  , Disney DIS  , Amazon AMZN  , WarnerMedia, Sinclair Broadcasting and others.  makeArticleAd();  Notably, the streaming market is expected to witness CAGR of 19.1% from 2018 to 2025 and reach $124.57 billion by 2025, per Grand View Research. Moreover, average revenue per user (ARPU) is expected to be $91.37 in the United States in 2019 and is expected to reach $98.64 by 2023, per Statista.    The host of new services promises quality experience for customers at a cheaper cost, the major reason behind the proliferation of over-the-top (OTT) viewing in the last couple of years. It is expected that almost all traditional media companies will have an OTT solution in the long haul.   Will Netflix Face the Heat?    Netflix's NFLX  portfolio strength supported by aggressive spending ($13 billion estimated in 2018) gives it a huge competitive advantage. Moreover, the company's recent decision  to hike subscription price reflects its confidence in its content despite intensifying competition.        Netflix's focus on originals - both movies and TV shows - has been the key catalyst behind the company's surging subscriber base (137 million at the end of third quarter 2018). The company's decision to use big data analysis while developing its content lineup helped it big time.    The impressive content quality along with Netflix's strategy change to give its original movies more theatrical exposure helped the company win awards and accolades in 2018.   Roma  was announced the best movie of 2018 by the New York Film Critics Circle and won the Golden Lion Award. The movie also won the award for best foreign-language film at this year's Golden Globes.   Netflix, Inc. Revenue (TTM)

Further, in the television category, Netflix's The Kominsky Method  won the Golden Globes for best comedy or musical. The streaming giant won five Golden Globes, beating all other studios.    Moreover, its user data collection practice and analysis has helped the company test a few unique features. Notably, Netflix is testing  a replay feature, where a "watch that scene again" pop good is being incorporated and tested on popular movies like Mowgli  and Dumplin  .    The company recently forayed into interactive films with the release of Black Mirror: Bandersnatch  . The move is expected to boost user engagement. Also, Netflix may use user participation data in marketing strategies to lure customers.    Netflix, which has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is also diversifying its content portfolio. The company is working on projects across India, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, Brazil, France, Turkey and the Middle East.    However, Netflix does not offer news and sports content and has no plans for the same in the near term, per management.   NBC's Portfolio Strength, Sky to Aid its Reach    NBCUniversal is set to launch its streaming service in early 2020. Despite being a late entrant, with its free ad-supported service, the company is expected to hit the right audience of pay-TV subscribers. Notably, about 80% of viewers in the United States have cable or satellite subscriptions even in the streaming age, per NBC CEO Steve Burke.    This depicts the strength and leverage the company can get by promoting the service to pay-TV subscribers, even outside the Comcast and Sky ecosystem. Notably, NBCUniversal is looking to strike deals with other cable companies including Charter and DISH to promote its streaming service.   Comcast Corporation Revenue (TTM)

Moreover, NBCUniversal can bank on NBC's popularity among its viewers. Notably, NBC was rated  the most-watched TV network in 2018 due to its strong content portfolio including popular shows This Is Us  and sports content including Super Bowl and Winter Olympics among others. Further, its viewer base increased 9% year over year to 7,876,000 at a time when more people were cutting the cord.    NBCUniversal's decision to add live sports to its service might give it an edge, especially with the upcoming 2020 Olympics. Additionally, following the acquisition of Sky, NBCUniversal will have the flexibility to cross bad its content to customers in the United States and Europe, thereby boosting its content portfolio.    Moreover, the company may consider owning exclusive rights to The Office  and DreamWorks Animation films, after Netflix's term ends. Further, with Comcast and Sky's tremendous reach, NBCUniversal may have the highest subscriber base among the newly launched services.    Burke noted that in spite of its plans to launch a streaming service, Comcast, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, will continue to hold its 30% state in Hulu, which recently added  more U.S. subscribers than Netflix. Notably, other stakeowners in Hulu are Disney (30%), Fox (30%) and AT & T (10%).   Disney, Amazon & Apple Strong Contenders Too    Disney already has ESPN+ to showcase its sports content and will soon launch Disney+  in 2019, its standalone streaming service. However, a user who prefers to watch both on-demand and sports is forced to good two subscription services. Currently, Disney carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).    Amazon offers on-demand and sports content. Notably, Prime users can access 11 TNF games for 2019 season and Premier League soccer games in the UK starting 2019. Moreover, it recently launched  a free video streaming channel called IMDb Freedive.    Amazon has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.     Moreover, Apple has been on a spending spree to scoop good original TV and film content, featuring some of the biggest directors and actors in Hollywood, to support the launch of its streaming service as soon as March 2019.    Notably, the company planned to spend $1 billion on original programming in 2018 and is expected to spend $4.2 billion by 2022. Also, the company is continuously focusing on acquiring/partnering with Oscar winning content makers to create a place for itself. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank #3.   More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!    It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple bad a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.

Notably, Azure's growing clout among retail players like Walmart WMT  , which is also involved in the healthcare space, bodes well.    Furthermore, synergies from GitHub buyout bode well for the Microsoft's intention of good presence in the healthcare sector and EHR market.Notably, migrating all the medical records to an EHR system for small clinics is time consuming and expensive.    Microsoft, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, intends to provide cost benefits to small clinics with the help of stored APIs and open source codes on GitHub. Consequently, these clinics can store their data efficiently and safely by leveraging Azure API and the open codes.

The company has formed a joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A  and JPMorgan Chase JPM  to provide enhanced healthcare facilities to its employees.    Moreover, the launch of Amazon Comprehend Medical is in sync with its aim to transform the industry which is still utilizing traditional and time-consuming methods.
